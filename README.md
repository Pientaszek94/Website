Hi User!
It's nice that you are reading this now, because I want you to know that THIS particular App was made with a little bit love of retro styling and sense of humor. You can find few comments within code that remind about pop-culture, while viewing whole algorithm. PWL-FrontDev App is built completely by myself with cool features that I found, browsing the Web. The App is continously upgraded with cooler features to make the App more attracive. Currently, You can Write/Update/Delete Articles, when you are regsitered/Signed In.
My Web App can be also viewed trough web browser, just type https://pwlfrontdev.herokuapp.com
